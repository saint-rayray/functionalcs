# FUNCTIONAL CS
## Progress
1. ~~Introduction~~
    1. ~~Studying Strategies~~
    *I'll consider it done, there's always ways to improve in this regard*
    1. ~~Discord channel~~
1. **Preliminaries**
    1. ~~Introduction to Computer Science~~
    *Mostly complete, can fill in the gaps when they come up~
    1. **Tools**
    *Currently doing missing semester in case it ends up making my life easier*
    3. ~~Assumed Mathematical Background~~
    *Skipping to LA/Calc, definitely holes to fill but now I can make sure I'm thoroughly filling them in without falling behind*
