# Brief Notes on Studying

## What to study
Something a little harder than what you're comfortable with, then backfill. Make sure you're interested.

## How to study
Take breaks often, content settles when you are relaxed and in diffuse mode. Yet to find what ratio works well for me. Used spaced repetition: Read last week's review, then read yesterday's review. Study. Write a review. Or something like that. Don't multitask. Don't assume that because you know something, you understand it. The Feynman technique usually tells which stage you are at.

QUICKLY LEARNED = QUICKLY FORGOTTEN

Try problems yourself first, don't do easy re-reading, test yourself often

## How to get yourself to study
Work is work, use pomodoro and don't focus too much on achieving anything other than just a bit of study for the day
Use todo lists, keep them clear of crap. Not sure they work well for me (as a motivator)
Have a clean study environment. Comfy, tidy, fresh etc.
DO THE HARDEST TASK OF THE DAY FIRST
Set a quitting time, work expands to fill the time you have.

# Daily Guide
